# CIS250_Create04_Aggregation
For this assignment you will be using a jupyter notebook to learn, practice, and create queries that aggregate data from one or more tables. You will be using the Guitar Store database tables for these queries. To assist with query creation, an ERD has been provided in the repo. The ERD is under GuitarStoreERD.pdf. I would recommend printing this if you have a printer available. There is a set of exercises and a scenario at the end of the starter file that will be graded. The rest of the jupyter notebook file is for you to practice and prepare for the graded exercises.

## Before Starting
1. Ensure that you have completed the practice assignment succesfully.
2. Complete the Practice Jupyter Notebook assignment.

## Assignment Description
* There are a total of four exercises and one scenario that you will complete.
* Each exercise/scenario is expressed as a business need that you must write a query to satisfy.


## Assignment Requirements
* You must write all of your scripts in the Create file and check it into github
* For full credit your scripts must return the requested result exactly
* You must use best practices in your scripts. Proper casing, spacing, and formatting are required.

## Tips
* The first few rows of the expected output are embedded in the notebook so that you can check your solution.
* Remember your order of operations for both symbols like parenthesis and logical operators like and/or/not.
* If you get stuck, make a post in the Homework Help channel in Teams.
